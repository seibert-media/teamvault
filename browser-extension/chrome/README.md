TeamVault Chrome Extension
==========================

This is a Manifest V3 Chrome extension that integrates with TeamVault to search, view, and autofill credentials on websites. It uses TeamVault's session-based auth and REST API under `/api/`.

Features
- Configurable TeamVault base URL in Options
- Session authentication via normal web login flow
- Popup search with per-site suggestions (auto-search by hostname)
- Autofill username/password on the active page
- One-time password (OTP) fill when available (copies to clipboard if no OTP field is present)
- Inline "TV" button on login fields for 1â€‘click fill (longâ€‘press for quick chooser, shows pinned label)
- Pin a secret per site to make it the default
- Copy actions: password and username from the popup
- Light/Dark/Auto theme for popup and options
- Prefer pinned option (global) to always place pinned first, even when searching
- Perâ€‘site preferences: autoâ€‘submit and inline button overrides
  - Plus pin a default secret for the current site
- Privacy: Optional pre-warming (global or per-site), off by default, with live status + refresh in the popup
- Performance: Cookie-aware auth refresh, caching for auth/suggestions/search (auto-clears when the Base URL changes)
 - Polished popup: shows current site on top, iconized auth (ðŸ”“/ðŸ”’) and pre-warm (ðŸ”¥/ðŸ’¤), accent-colored links
 - Keyboard navigation in popup: Up/Down to select, Enter to Fill (hold Shift/Ctrl/âŒ˜ for Fill+Submit)

How auth works
- The extension never stores your password; it relies on your TeamVault web session cookie.
- Click "Sign in" in Options to open your TeamVault login page. After logging in, the extension can call the API with `credentials: include`.
- The extension checks auth by calling `GET <BASE_URL>/api/secrets/`.

SameSite cookies note
- Chrome treats extension requests as cross-site. If your Django session cookie uses `SameSite=Lax/Strict` (default), it wonâ€™t be sent to extension-origin fetches.
- The extension falls back to performing API requests from a tab at your TeamVault origin (page context) with `credentials: include`, which receives your session cookie. Use HTTPS in production.
- For local development over HTTP, enable "Allow HTTP (dev)" in Options to permit non-HTTPS Base URLs and origin permissions.

Install (Unpacked)
1. In Chrome, open `chrome://extensions` and enable Developer Mode.
2. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `browser-extension` folder.
3. Click the extension icon and open Options to set your TeamVault Base URL (e.g. `https://vault.example.com`).
4. Click "Sign in" to authenticate in a new tab. When done, return to the popup.
5. If you later change the Base URL, the extension clears cached suggestions/search results, resets auth state, and may prompt again for host permissions.

Usage
- Navigate to a login page.
- Use the inline button:
  - Click the small "TV" button near the password field to fill the best match.
  - Longâ€‘press the "TV" button to pick among the top matches.
- Or use the popup:
  - Click the extension icon: youâ€™ll see auto-searched results for the site and a search box.
  - Actions: Fill, Fill + Submit, Copy pass, Copy user, OTP, Pin/Unpin.
  - Keyboard: Up/Down to move selection. Enter to Fill. Hold Shift/Ctrl/âŒ˜ to Fill + Submit.
  - Click the secret name to open it in TeamVault; click the URL to open the site.
  - Use the ðŸ”¥/ðŸ’¤ button in the header to view and refresh the pre-warm cache for the current site.

Permissions
- Host permission is requested only for your TeamVault origin (approve via Options â†’ Grant site permission, or from the popup when prompted). By default, HTTP origins are blocked unless you enable "Allow HTTP (dev)".
- The extension uses `storage` for settings, `tabs`/`scripting` for messaging/injection, and `cookies` for cookie-aware auth refresh scheduling.
- If you enable preâ€‘warming, the extension may fetch suggestions for the active site in the background. You can restrict this globally or perâ€‘site.

Notes
- Only GET API endpoints are used (no secret creation/deletion). CSRF is not required.
- Matching uses the secret `url` field; the popup auto-searches by hostname and treats `www.` as equivalent to the bare domain.
- You can disable the inline button or change the theme in Options.
 - Perâ€‘site settings (Options): override autoâ€‘submit and inline button for the active site.
